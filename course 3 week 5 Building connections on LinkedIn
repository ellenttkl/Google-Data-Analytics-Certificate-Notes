 Here's an example (template) that you can use to connect with a former co-worker:

Hi <fill in name here>,

Please accept my invitation to connect. It has been a while since we were at <fill in company name here> and I look forward to catching up with you. 
I’m looking for job opportunities and would love to hear about what you’re doing and who is hiring in your organization.  

Best regards,

Here are some tips for asking for a recommendation: 

1.Reach out to a variety of people for a 360-degree view: supervisors, co-workers, direct reports, partners, and clients

2.Personalize the recommendation request with a custom message

3.Suggest strengths and capabilities they can highlight as part of your request

4.Be willing to write a recommendation in return

Here's an example (template) that you can use to ask for a recommendation:

Hi <fill in name here>,
How are you? I hope you are well. I’m preparing for a new job search and would appreciate it if you could write a recommendation that highlights my <insert your specific skill here>. Our experience working on <insert project here> is a great example and I would be happy to provide other examples if you need them. Please let me know if I can write a recommendation for you. I would be very glad to return the favor.
Thanks in advance for your support!
